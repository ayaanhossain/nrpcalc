    "Genetic parts exhibit their activity through biophysical interactions that rely on **DNA** or **RNA** sequence motifs, the presence or absence of specific RNA structures, and/or higher-order sequence or structural characteristics. For example, a constitutive σ<sup>70</sup> _E. coli_ promoter sequence will have a high transcription initiation rate when it contains a conserved $-35$ and $-10$ hexamer, separated by a $17$ base pair spacer. Likewise, a bacterial transcriptional terminator will have a high efficiency when it contains a fast-folding, stable RNA hairpin, followed by a U-rich tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such essential characteristics can be flexibly distilled into a set of criteria that every generated genetic part sequence must satisfy. The `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator` `Maker Mode` accepts three types of genetic part constraints: a degenerate DNA or RNA sequence using the **IUPAC code**; an essential RNA secondary structure using _dot-parenthesis-x_ notation; and a model-based constraint that can be customized to quantify the presence of higher-order interactions or to facilitate the synthesis and construction of the genetic system by excluding sequences (e.g. restriction sites and polymeric sequences). All three constraints may be simultaneously used to specify a set of genetic part sequences with desired functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As examples, **Supplementary Table 2** of our [publication](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-020-0584-2/MediaObjects/41587_2020_584_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) (see page 30) lists the design constraints and algorithm outcomes for a wide variety of genetic parts commonly used in synthetic biology, including minimal Pol II promoters, insulated ribosome binding sites, prokaryotic transcriptional terminators, and toehold RNA switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one sense, these genetic part constraints are explicit hypotheses that distill one’s knowledge of gene regulation and biophysics into the simplest possible computable form. In another sense, they are a type of classifier that separates the genetic part sequence space into only two categories: sequences expected to have some amount of genetic part activity versus sequences expected to have minimal to none activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** The design constraints are not a quantitative prediction of functional activity; experimental characterization is still needed to validate designed parts. In general, it is advantageous to incorporate as much degeneracy into the constraints as possible to design larger toolboxes."

    "To do that, we can define some _model functions_ to help us generate promoters that are compatible for our cloning purposes. Importantly, while we can define functions to explicitly prevent our used cutsites (say, BamHI or XbaI, specifically), it would be better to prevent the occurence of any palindromic hexamer in our parts, which is usually a property of many restriction sites. That way, our promoters can be cloned and used in a variety of scenerios, without us having to restrict ourselves to using only the ones in which the specific restriction site motifs are absent, for a given cloning workflow.\n",

    "> **Note** The `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator` can optimize two types of functions for us - a **local model function** which is applied on a genetic part concurrently with addition of each nucleotide, and a **global model function** which is applied on a genetic part when it is fully constructed. The local model function must accept a single argument called `seq` (the partial sequence under construction) and returns either `(True, None)` if an evaluation was satisfied, or `(False, index)` where `index` is a traceback location where nucleotide choices need to be altered to fulfill an objective. The global model function also must accept a single input `seq` (a fully constructed sequence), and return either `True` if an objective was met, or `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now develop a new objective function to prevent palindromic hexamers in our designed promoters to be evaluated concurrently as each new base is added to a promoter towards completion (a local model function). Our function will start evaluation when the **sixth** base (base at `index=5` or equivalently, when `len(seq)=6`) is added to a partial promoter under construction (necessary condition for evaluation), and guide the design process to steer clear of palindromic hexamers. We will also define any helper functions we need, and test our logic as we move forward."

    "> **Note** It is important to be careful about string indexing when the function logic becomes moderately complex. For example, in `Python` strings are $0$-indexed, which means that the $-35$ hexamer starts after the first $20$ bases in the upstream region at index $20$ (i.e. the $21$st base belongs to $-35$). It is also important to note when a model function should be evaluated. For example, if the evaluation logic requires at least an $8$-bp sequence, parts shorter than that length should be evaluated `True` to let the sequence grow long enough for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** When there are multiple local objectives at play that evaluate properties of the partial sequence at an upstream location, it is often advantageous to return the traceback index that occurs earlier in the sequence position. For example, one thing we could do in a meta local model function is evaluate two objectives, and return `(False, min(index1, index2))` if both objective functions failed with different traceback locations, or just `(False, index1)` if only the first one failed and so on. We could also weigh the various objectives differently, and choose to return the most important traceback index first, rather than the second most important traceback index etc.\n",

    "> **Note** It is possible to embed external models as evaluators into the `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator`. For example, rather than only preventing cryptic motifs as shown above, we could have also used a `scikit-learn` `Lasso` model, as described in [our publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0584-2), to design promoters within specific dynamic ranges. We would load the model (unpickle) into memory, and for every promoter completely constructed by `Maker`, we would evaluate the predicted initation rate and only accept parts that satisfied our criteria (a global model function). Alternatively, we could further identify, using the model, which of the components (hexamers, spacer GC etc.) prevented a part from being accepted, and returned a traceback index accordingly (i.e. converted the global into a local model function) to explore nucleotide choices concurrently with part design.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** It is always a good idea to test the individual functions called by a meta local or global model function, using simple cases. Notice, how we have `assert`-ed a few test cases for the helper functions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** If `Maker` takes an impossible amount of time to create a single part in the prescence of a model function, it is worth investigating if the model function in context gets stuck in an infinite loop or an edge case. A quick check would be to run `Maker` with all constraints except the model function. If `Maker` is able to design parts quickly in the absence of the model function, then the slow-down is naturally due to the the model function itself, which should be investigated and optimized."

What this means is that, in a scenario consisting of a list of repetitive parts, the returned non-repetitive subset is approximately the largest possible non-repetitive toolbox, but this may change slightly across multiple runs for the same set of inputs. There is no way known, generally, to be certain of what the absolutely largest toolbox size actually is (unless all parts were either repetitive or non-repetitive as in the case during verification of parts returned by `Maker`), so we retained a level of stochasticity in `Finder`. This encourages us to run `Finder` (which is pretty fast in practice) several times on a candidate toolbox of parts, and then select the largest non-repetitive toolbox returned across all runs."

    "Before we design the RBS toolbox, we must note that the constraint for RBS toolbox here includes an `Lmax` of $14$, whereas, the promoters were designed with an `Lmax` of $12$ bases. This is because, there is a big $9$-bp constant Shine-Dalgarno motif in the sequence constraint which doesn't leave too many $13$-mers (recall `Lmax=12`) for constructing thousands of non-repetitive RBSs. As proof, let's try constructing the RBS toolbox with `Lmax=12`, without using any `background`and only using the fast `mfe` (minimum free energy) structure evaluation (a relaxed design scenerio). We will additionally specify the `fail_count` parameter in `Maker` to terminate on $2000$ consecutive failures instead of the default value of $1000$ (deeper exploration of design space)."

If we wanted, we could try increasing the `jump_count` and/or `fail_count` (see [API](https://github.com/ayaanhossain/nrpcalc/blob/master/docs/DOCS.md)) to try to reach all $256$ of the possible RBSs, although the severe structure constraint might prevent selection of some _k_-mers to realize all of these sequences."

    "Now, that we've decided to use an `Lmax=14` for our toolbox, how do we unify our present RBS toolbox with the previously designed promoter toolboxes with `Lmax=12`, in terms of non-repetitiveness? It is a feature of the `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator` that one can use a `background` initialized with an `Lmax` which is different from the `Lmax` specified for the design job at hand. So, for designing our RBSs, it would be legal and recommended to use `bkg` as the `background` (having `Lmax=12`), while our new RBS toolbox would be built with an `Lmax` of $14$. This would ensure that there is no $13$-mer in the designed RBSs that also exists in `bkg` (promoter _k_-mers), while also ensuring that no two RBSs in the toolbox shared a $15$-mer between each other.\n",

    "Alternative approaches include (1) initializing a new `background` with `Lmax=14` and inserting all previous promoters into it, followed by using the new `background` for designing RBSs, or (2) defining a new local model function that prevents every $13$-mer in the new RBSs under construction from coinciding with the previous `background` (`bkg` - containing the $13$-mers from the promoters).\n",

    "In this $15$-mer window, the last four bases are always going to be complementary to the first four bases. So, as soon as the first four bases ('N's) are filled in by `Maker`, the fate of the last four bases are automatically determined (they will be complementary to the first four bases). The $7$-bp SD motif is a constant in our sequence constraint which leaves only the first four bases to be selected variably by `Maker`, resulting in the last four bases becoming a dynamically inserted constant for each imaginable run. Thus, instead of working with a degenerate $15$-bp window with $7$ bases fixed, we're actually working with a $15$-bp window with $7+4=11$ bases fixed. This leaves us with $4^4 = 256$ possible nucleotide combinations to fill up this window, implying, a theoretical maximum toolbox size of only $256$ toehold switches. Our goal for $1000$ non-repetitive toehold switches, even with `Lmax=14`, will not be fulfilled given how we have framed the sequence and structure constraint."

    "Rather than abandoning hope, we may go back to the original paper for insights. It is clear that an RBS must be located between the two halves of domain _B_, but should this RBS just consist of a consensus $7$-bp SD motif only? The motif can potentially be \"padded\" on either side, and still leave us with effective RBSs. Accordingly, we will modify our sequence constraint to pad the SD motif with three 'N's on the $5'$-end, while ensuring that those bases remain unpaired via our modified structure constraint. This expands our design space by sixty four fold, making our goal of $1000$ non-repetitive toehold switches a real possibility. Let's re-define the constraints, and review them one last time."

We hope to convince you that the `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator` can be a useful tool in your arsenal in your quest for genetic systems engineering. We had a lot of fun developing this notebook, and we hope you'll share it with your students and colleagues who might benefit from the `Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator`. Despite our thrust on clarity, if any part of this notebook remains ambiguous or unclear to you, please reach the authors, who'd be more than delighted to explain or update this notebook accordingly.\n",
